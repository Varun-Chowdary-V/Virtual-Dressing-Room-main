# Virtual 3D Fitting Room Web Application

Welcome to the Virtual 3D Fitting Room! This web application revolutionizes the online shopping experience by allowing users to virtually try on clothing and visualize how outfits will fit them using **3D modeling** and **Augmented Reality (AR)**. The system provides a personalized and realistic shopping experience, bridging the gap between in-store and online retail.

## Key Features

- **3D Body Modeling**  
   Generate a realistic 3D model of the user's body using computer vision and input measurements. This enables accurate visualization of clothing fit.

- **Augmented Reality (AR)**  
   Utilize AR technology to overlay 3D clothing models onto the user's body in real-time via a webcam or smartphone camera, offering an immersive try-on experience.

- **Clothing Fit Prediction**  
   Machine learning algorithms analyze user measurements and recommend the best size and fit, minimizing guesswork and returns.

- **Interactive Product Catalog**  
   Browse, filter, and select clothing items from a dynamic catalog with 3D previews.

- **Personalized Recommendations**  
   Suggest clothing based on user preferences, measurements, and previous interactions.

- **Real-Time Visualization**  
   Rotate, zoom, and view selected clothing on the 3D body model from multiple angles using WebGL and Three.js.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
   An intuitive React-based front-end provides seamless navigation and interaction.
